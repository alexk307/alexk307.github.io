I'm a software engineer out of Baltimore interested in learning and creating as much as I can. This blog serves as a chronicle of my projects as well as some of the things I have learned along the way.
I'm also a <a href="https://untappd.com/user/akahan">beer nerd</a> and a <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/gabbagabbahey38">music geek</a>.
